## Installation

This application uses node.js; navigate to the directory containing index.js and run npm install from the commandline in order to get the dependencies necessary to run it.


## Usage

Similar to installation, once npm install has been run and the dependencies acquired, simply type "node index.js" in the same directory and the application will run and prompt you to enter your information!

A demonstration video of how to run the app, as well as any included unit tests, is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UEIMz24KMc).

## Features


- Add as many team members as you'd like; even feel free to extend to default class behaviours with more of your own.


- The generated HTML is a straightforward and simple template that serves as a great base for expansion.
